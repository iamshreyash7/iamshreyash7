## 🌱 About Me

I'm a **beginner blockchain developer** just starting my journey into Web3 and smart contracts! Currently learning Solidity and exploring the exciting world of decentralized applications.

- 🔭 Just built my **first blockchain project** - Cronos x402 Spending Wallet!
- 🌱 Currently learning **Solidity basics** and **smart contract development**
- 📚 Exploring **Web3**, **Ethereum**, and **DeFi concepts**
- 🎯 Goal: Build more projects and contribute to the Web3 ecosystem
- 💡 Learning by doing - building real projects to understand blockchain better
- 🤝 Made this with help from friends and AI tools - still learning every day!

## 🚀 My First Project!

### 🤖 [Cronos x402 Spending Wallet](https://github.com/iamshreyash7/cronos-x402-spending-wallet)
**My first blockchain project - A spending wallet for AI agents**

This is my first ever smart contract project! I built it for the Cronos x402 Hackathon with help from friends. It allows you to give AI agents spending limits - they can make payments but only up to a certain amount.

**What I learned building this:**
- ✅ Writing my first Solidity smart contract
- ✅ Deploying contracts to Cronos Testnet
- ✅ Connecting a website to blockchain with MetaMask
- ✅ Using Ethers.js for Web3 interactions
- ✅ How blockchain transactions work
- ✅ Debugging smart contracts and fixing errors

**Tech used:** Solidity, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Ethers.js, MetaMask
